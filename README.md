# Backorder Prediction Modeling

This project aims to predict whether a product will go on backorder. A backorder is an order that cannot be fulfilled at the given time due to lack of supply or the product being out of stock. The project uses machine learning prediction processes to overcome the associated tangible and intangible costs of backorders. The project also lists major probable backorder scenarios to facilitate business decisions.

The project is divided into the following sections:

- Introduction
- Business Problem
- Existing Solutions
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Handling Class Imbalance
- Feature Engineering
- Performance Metrics
- Modelling and Evaluation
