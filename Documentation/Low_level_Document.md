# **Low-Level Document Design for Backorder Prediction using Machine Learning Technology**

**1. Introduction**

**1.1 Purpose**

The purpose of this document is to describe the low-level implementation details of a software system that can predict whether a product will go on backorder, which is a situation where a customer orders a product that is out of stock, and the supplier has to fulfill the order later. The system will use machine learning technology to analyze historical and current data of various products, such as inventory level, lead time, sales, performance, and backorder status, and generate predictions and recommendations for inventory management, customer satisfaction, and sales optimization.
