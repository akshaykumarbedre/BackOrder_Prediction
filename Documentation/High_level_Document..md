# **High-Level Document Design for Backorder Prediction using Machine Learning Technology**

**1. Introduction**

**1.1 Purpose**

The purpose of this document is to describe the high-level architecture and design of a software system that can predict whether a product will go on backorder, which is a situation where a customer orders a product that is out of stock, and the supplier has to fulfill the order later. The system will use machine learning technology to analyze historical and current data of various products, such as inventory level, lead time, sales, performance, and backorder status, and generate predictions and recommendations for inventory management, customer satisfaction, and sales optimization.

**1.2 Scope**

The scope of this document covers the high-level design of the system, such as its components, interfaces, data flows, and dependencies. The document does not cover the low-level design or the implementation details of the system, such as the algorithms, code, or testing methods. The document also does not cover the business or user requirements of the system, such as the use cases, scenarios, or user stories.

**2. System Overview**

**2.1 System Description**

The system is a software system that can predict whether a product will go on backorder, which is a situation where a customer orders a product that is out of stock, and the supplier has to fulfill the order later. The system will use machine learning technology to analyze historical and current data of various products, such as inventory level, lead time, sales, performance, and backorder status, and generate predictions and recommendations for inventory management, customer satisfaction, and sales optimization.

The system will consist of two main components: a machine learning component and a web application component. The machine learning component will be responsible for processing and transforming the data, training and evaluating different models, selecting and saving the best model, and making predictions on new data. The web application component will be responsible for providing a user interface for the system, allowing the user to input and view the data, select and configure the model, and see the predictions and recommendations.

The system will use a public data set from Kaggle that contains information about various products, such as inventory level, lead time, sales, performance, and backorder status. The system will use Python as the main programming language, and use various libraries and frameworks, such as pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, pickle, Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

**2.2 System Context**

The system will be used by the business owners or managers of a company that sells products online or offline, and wants to optimize their inventory management, customer satisfaction, and sales. The system will help them to identify which products are likely to go out of stock and need to be replenished, and which products are not likely to go out of stock and can be reduced. The system will also help them to understand the factors that affect the backorder status of the products, and provide suggestions for improving the performance and service level of the products.

The system will interact with the following external entities:

- Users: The users are the business owners or managers who will use the system to input and view the data, select and configure the model, and see the predictions and recommendations.
- Data source: The data source is the public data set from Kaggle that contains information about various products, such as inventory level, lead time, sales, performance, and backorder status.
- Web browser: The web browser is the software application that the users will use to access the web application component of the system, and communicate with the system via HTTP requests and responses.

**2.3 System Objectives**

The main objectives of the system are:

- To predict whether a product will go on backorder, which is a situation where a customer orders a product that is out of stock, and the supplier has to fulfill the order later.
- To provide recommendations for inventory management, customer satisfaction, and sales optimization, based on the predictions and the data analysis.
- To provide a user-friendly and responsive web interface for the system, that allows the user to input and view the data, select and configure the model, and see the predictions and recommendations.

**2.4 System Stakeholders**

The main stakeholders of the system are:

- Users: The users are the business owners or managers who will use the system to input and view the data, select and configure the model, and see the predictions and recommendations. They are the primary beneficiaries of the system, and their needs and expectations should be met by the system.
- Developers: The developers are the software engineers who will design, implement, test, and maintain the system. They are the primary creators of the system, and their skills and expertise should be utilized by the system.
- Testers: The testers are the software engineers who will verify and validate the system. They are the primary evaluators of the system, and their feedback and suggestions should be incorporated by the system.

**3. System Architecture**

**3.1 Logical Structure**

The system will have a three-tier architecture, consisting of the following layers:

- Presentation layer: This layer will handle the user interface and the user interaction of the system. It will consist of the web application component, which will use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to create a dynamic and responsive web page that will communicate with the user and the application layer via HTTP requests and responses.
- Application layer: This layer will handle the business logic and the data processing of the system. It will consist of the machine learning component, which will use Python, pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, and pickle to process and transform the data, train and evaluate different models, select and save the best model, and make predictions on new data. It will communicate with the presentation layer and the data layer via HTTP
